## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

### Adding a New Resource

- Add your resource to the **most relevant section** of `Readme.md`.
- Use the following format:
  ```
  - [Resource Name](https://link-to-resource) – Short description of what it does.
  ```
- The description should be **concise** (one sentence) and start with a capital letter.
- Make sure the link is **working and publicly accessible**.
- Avoid duplicate entries — check the list first.

### Proposing a New Section

- If your resource doesn't fit any existing section, open an **issue** first to discuss adding a new section.
- New sections must have at least **3 resources** to be included.

### Removing or Updating Resources

- If a resource is outdated, unmaintained, or the link is broken, please open an issue or a PR with the fix.

## 🚫 What Not to Submit

- Paid or closed-source tools without a meaningful free tier.
- Personal projects without significant community adoption.
- Resources unrelated to React or its ecosystem.
- Duplicate entries already listed.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Keep pull requests **small and focused** — one resource or fix per PR is ideal.
- Write a clear PR description explaining what you're adding and why it belongs.
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
